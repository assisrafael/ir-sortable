ir-sortable
==============

This is a fork of [a5hik/ng-sortable](https://github.com/a5hik/ng-sortable) that only changes the directive name to avoid colisions with another directives, like [ng-table](https://github.com/esvit/ng-table).

I recommend you to use the original repository instead of this fork.
